      <h1>Workshops, Courses and Winter Schools Organized by APLAC</h1>

<p class='abstract'>Accumulation of experiences, insights, records, data and
             knowledge is meaningless unless shared among people to be carried
             on and improved and re-shared. APLAC therefor organizes workshops,
             conferences, courses and winter schools. Researchers of APLAC
             join conferences or give talks on topics we can contribute to.
