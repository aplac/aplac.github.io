      <h1>Conferences Organized by APLAC</h1>

      <h2 class='inv'>From DRGT2011 to DRGPA2025</h2>

      <p class='abstract'>Since 2015 the researchers of APLAC/Thakbong
      have been organizing with different partner organizations a
      bi-annual conference on the topic of burial practices. The
      conferences, initially focusing on burial practices in Taiwan,
      triggered fruitful exchanges with researchers and organizations
      working on similar topics in East and South-East Asia.  To be
      more inclusive and welcoming, the conference has been renamed
      in 2019 from DRGT2011, DRGT2015, DRGT2017 (Documenting and
      Researching Gravesites in Taiwan) to DRGPA2019, DRGPA2021
      and DRGPA2023.<p/>

      <p>The next conference in this series will be <a href="drgpa2025.html">DRGT2025</a>, to be held at the National University of Kaohsiung, Taiwan on November 13th to 15th. </p>
