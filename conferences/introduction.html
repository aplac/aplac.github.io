      <h1>Conferences Organized by APLAC</h1>

      <h2 class='inv'>From DRGT2011 to DRGPA2023</h2>

      <p class='abstract'>Since 2015 the researchers of 
      APLAC/Thakbong have been organizing
      with different partner organizations a bi-annual conference on the 
      topic of burial practices. The conferences, initially focusing on
      burial practices in Taiwan, triggered fruitful exchanges with researchers
      and organizations working on similar topics in East and South-East Asia. 
      To be more inclusive and welcoming, the conference has been renamed in 2019      from DRGT2011, DRGT2015, DRGT2017 (Documenting and Researching Gravesites       in Taiwan) to DRGPA2019, DRGPA2021 and DRGPA2023.<p/>
