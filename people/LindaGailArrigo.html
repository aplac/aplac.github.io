In 2007, Prof Linda Gail Arrigo started to take out her students of
the Taipei Medical University to a nearby complex of gravesites, including
the burial grounds of the White Terror of Kuomintang in Taiwan, a Muslim
graveyard of Mainlanders who arrived on Taiwan in the aftermath of the
Chinese Civil War and the Fude-Graveyard, a graveyard of mainly Mainlanders,
but also local Taiwanese.

In 2010, Oliver Streiter and Yoann Goudin contacted Linda Gail Arrigo
and they arranged a first meeting in the autumn of 2010. After Yoann
returned to France, Oliver and Linda continued to visit and document
various gravesites in the Taipei area between 2010 and 2018. Frequently
a fieldtrip was staged after Linda, who likes to hike the mountainous
surrounding of Taipei, had discovered a hence unknown burial ground or
some tombs spread along the trail.

In 2011 Linda Gail Arrigo and Oliver Streiter organized the <a
href='./../conferences/drgt2011.html'>First Conference on Documenting
and Researching Gravesites in Taiwan</a>. Already in 2011, the impending
disappearance of burial sites in Taiwan and the cultural and historical
loss this would imply for a new nation.
