It is administered by the Wat Saket which lies to the East and South of the Mount. In the 19th century, the mount was a site for sky burials when epidemics struck the city and deceased couldn\'t be burried or cremated due to the large number of people that fell victim to the epidemics.</div><div script="Latin" language="English" author="Oliver Streiter">Most tombs that can be found today on the Golden Mount are tombs of ethnic Chinese. These tombs date mainly from the first half of the 20th century. It may be assumed that the mount with canals running on two sides of the mount created a favorable fengshui that made this site a favorable burial sites for ethnic Chinese. Actually most Thai-Temples, i.e. most Wat, are actually burial sites. Although a little to the North-East of Chinatown, most shops on the Boriphat Road are of ethnic Chinese. Most of them involved in processing and trading of wood, with a historic focus on teak wood that has been shipped from the north of Thailand various waterways to Bangkok.</div></description><hypotheses><hypothesis author="Oliver Streiter">Most tombs on the Golden Mount are tombs of Chinese ethnicity.</hypothesis><hypothesis author="Oliver Streiter">Most Chinese tombs on the Golden Mount are tombs belonging to families that live in the area of the Golden Mount.</hypothesis></hypotheses><pi /><events></events><ref><event><agents /></event></ref><media /></ent></document>
