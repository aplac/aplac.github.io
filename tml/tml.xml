		<h2>Thakbong, Defining the Undefinable</h2>
		<div author="Oliver">The Thakbong project is an open-ended project, which in its current stage can best be described as a digital endeavor to document, archive and research epigraphy in the Taiwan Strait and beyond. The documentation consist of primary data, mostly photos, and secondary data, which are derived through the annotation of the photos. This data set contains the secondary data. The primary data, the photos, are linked from this file to their current repository in the cloud.
	        </div>
		<div author="Oliver"> The process of creating secondary data from the photos involves the transcription and translation of inscriptions, as well as the classification and description of entities. These entities can be sites, objects, physical or semiotic in nature, and events.
	        </div>
		<div author="Oliver">Classification relates the entities that we document, a house, an altar, a tombstone, a phrase, to one or more labels of a closed set of labels. These labels can be useful for analysis techniques as used in the Digital Humanities, such as the drawing of time-lines or the drawing of maps. Yet, these labels, one has to remember are human-made. They are valid within one culture, within one time, within one language. We don't try to give universal definitions of entities and their types and properties. Doing so would a) not be possible, b) not always meaningful, as the meaning resides in the specific language and culture. Instead, we try to keep track of the names and properties of the entities that communities and cultures assign to them. We also try to keep track of the labels that have been assigned to these entities in the past in the academic publications within a certain, time, language and culture. Different labels assigned to the same entity can focus on different aspects of the entity. They even can be contradictory. This is not a problem, as research in the humanities is not only research on entities created by humans, but also on the humans who classify and try to understand them. It is natural that the same entity can be classified and named differently in different times, languages and cultures.</div>

		<div author="Oliver"> Descriptions are different from classifications. Descriptions try to convey information mainly to people living in other times or other regions, to people who cannot or can no longer visit the documented sites as the sites no longer exist. The descriptions thus try to give them the best possible impression of sites and objects, which in a rapidly changing world are mostly bound to disappear. The transcriptions are written without a rigid scheme or a research question, or a classification scheme in mind and tell as much about the author of the description as about the site. The descriptions reveal the concern and bias of the researcher and thus allow to gauge the interest and the quality of the data.</div> 

		<div author="Oliver"> The secondary data are available under the license specified below. The primary data, images and videos, are less freely available. Basically, there is a different license for each media file, depending on who took the photo or video when, where and of what. Most photos and videos have been taken in the last 20 years and thus show the living environment of contemporaneous people, their habits, their houses, their tombs, their practices. We are preparing these data to become freely available in the future, trying to preserve the privacy of the people and communities we documented to some degree. If you want to use photos of videos you find linked from this archive, please contact the people signing responsible for this project. In most cases they will grant you the right to use media files for academic and non-commercial purposes if you refer to this archive, its location and, if known, the reserachers who took the photo. Below the name and URL for the license of the secondary data.</div>
