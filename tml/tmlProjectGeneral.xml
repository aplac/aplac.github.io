Instead, the projects are represented by "views", i.e. commands which from a thematic point of view collect and filter data out of a set of geographically organized XML files. This technique allows to store the data only in the geographically organized files, while appearing at the same time in various "virtual" views. By storing the data only once, we not only save space, but also keep the data consistent. This arrangement has a number of consequences for the user. First, the loading of these files might take longer, as a set of geographical data files are sent from the server to your browser and your browser has to filter them and compose a thematic view that ultimately describes the project. Second, in order to modify or enrich the data you find in the project view, you have to navigate to the data in the geographic file, the place where the piece of information actually resides. To facilitate this, we provide links pointing back to the original data.</div></description><project></project></document>
